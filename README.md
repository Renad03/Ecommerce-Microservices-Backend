# Ecommerce Microservices Backend

This project is a Spring Boot-based microservices backend for an e-commerce application. It follows a scalable and modular architecture built with Spring Cloud, enabling flexibility, service isolation, and easy maintainability.

The system is designed to be frontend-agnostic and can be integrated with any client-side technology ‚Äî including mobile apps (e.g., Flutter, React Native) and web apps (e.g., React, Angular).

The system is composed of three main microservices, each handling specific responsibilities:

    üëú Wallet Service: Manages user authentication, wallet balance, and financial transactions.

    üõçÔ∏è Shop Service: Handles product listings, shopping cart operations, order placement, and payment processing.

    üì¶ Inventory Service: Maintains inventory data, manages stock levels, and syncs product availability.

Additionally, the project includes:

    üß≠ Eureka Server: For service discovery across microservices.

    ‚öôÔ∏è Config Server: Centralized configuration management.

    üåê API Gateway: Routes and secures requests to the appropriate microservice.

Each microservice includes a standardized API response class to ensure consistent and clean communication between services and with the client.
