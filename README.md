# Ecommerce Microservices Backend

This is a microservices-based e-commerce application built with Spring Boot, featuring three core services: Wallet, Shop, and Inventory. Each service is independently deployable and interacts via RESTful APIs using Spring Cloud components like Eureka, Feign, API Gateway, and Resilience4j for fault tolerance.

The system is frontend-independent and can be integrated with any client-side technology ‚Äî including mobile apps (e.g., Flutter, React Native) and web apps (e.g., React, Angular).

Microservice Breakdown

    üëú Wallet Service: Manages user authentication, wallet balance, and financial transactions.

    üõçÔ∏è Shop Service: Handles product listings, shopping cart operations, order placement, and payment processing.

    üì¶ Inventory Service: Maintains inventory data, manages stock levels, and syncs product availability.

Supporting Services

    üß≠ Eureka Server: For service discovery across microservices.

    ‚öôÔ∏è Config Server: Centralized configuration management.

    üåê API Gateway: Routes and secures requests to the appropriate microservice.

Each microservice includes a standardized API response class to ensure consistent and clean communication between services and with the client.

## üõ°Ô∏è Fault Tolerance with Resilience4j

To ensure **reliability** and **stability**, the project integrates **[Resilience4j](https://resilience4j.readme.io/)**, a fault-tolerance library designed for Java microservices. It provides several powerful patterns for handling runtime failures and service outages.

### Key Features

- **Circuit Breakers**  
  Prevent cascading failures by temporarily halting calls to services that are failing. Automatically resets after a cooldown period.

- **Rate Limiters**  
  Restrict the number of calls to a service in a given time window to avoid overwhelming downstream systems.

- **Retry Mechanism**  
  Automatically retry failed requests a specified number of times before giving up.

- **Fallback Methods**  
  Gracefully handle service failures by providing default behavior or responses when the target service is down or unresponsive.

###  Where It's Used

These mechanisms are applied to **inter-service communication via Feign clients**, helping services recover from temporary issues such as:

- Network latency
- Service downtime
- Slow or unresponsive upstream dependencies
- Sudden traffic spikes
